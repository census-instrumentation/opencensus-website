<i class="fa fa fa-quote-left" style="color:#C1272D"></i> Kudos to whoever came up with the design and architecture of OpenCensus. Tried it for the first time yesterday and it was a great experience for me as a monitoring developer. It feels a lot more thought out and robust than other solutions. <i class="fa fa fa-quote-right" style="color:#C1272D"></i>

#### What is OpenCensus?
A single distribution of libraries that automatically collects traces and metrics from your app, displays them locally, and sends them to any analysis tool. See an [{{% sc_gloss1 %}}overview{{% /sc_gloss1 %}}](/overview).

#### Who is behind OpenCensus?
OpenCensus originates from Google, where a set of libraries called Census were used to automatically capture traces and metrics from services. Since going open source, the project is now composed of a group of cloud providers, application performance management vendors, and open source contributors. The project is hosted in GitHub and all work occurs there.
