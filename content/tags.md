Tags allow us to associate contextual key-value pairs with collected data.

After collection, tags can later be used as dimensions to break down the data and
analyze it from various different perspectives to target specific
cases in isolation even in highly complex systems.

Tags have keys and values. Examples of tags:

* {frontend: "web-0.12"}
* {frontend: "ios-10.2.12"}
* {http_endpoint: "server:8909/api/users"}

Frontend tag allow users to breakdown the data between web, iOS and Android users.
HTTP endpoint allows to filter or group by a specific endpoint when
looking at the HTTP latency data.

## Propagation

Tags may be defined in one service and used in a view in a different
service; they are propagated on the wire.

In distributed systems, a service is likely to be depending 
on many other services.
This results in many challenges when analyzing the data
collected at the lower ends of the stack.
Instrumentation at lower layer might not be very valuable
if data is not recorded with enough context.

Lower ends of the systems cannot have additional hardcoded context, this
would leak details of higher levels services to the lower level.
Instead, we use tag propagation.
Higher level services produce tags, and lower-end uses them when
recording data.

Above, frontend depends on the authentication service. Authentication
service needs to query database that depends on the lower-level
blob storage service. In this case the originator tag has been
propagated as a part of the requests all through the stack. And
blob storage can easily record data with the originator tag.
The data analysis backends can group data by originator and blob storage service
can tell the impact of higher level users on their service.
