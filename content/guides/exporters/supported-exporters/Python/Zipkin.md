This guide makes use of Zipkin for visualizing your data. For assistance setting up Zipkin, [Click here](/codelabs/zipkin) for a guided codelab.

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.

It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the Google Dapper paper.

OpenCensus Python has support for this exporter available through package [opencensus.trace.exporters.zipkin_exporter](https://census-instrumentation.github.io/opencensus-python/trace/api/zipkin_exporter.html)

##### Creating the exporter
To create the exporter, we'll need to:

* Create an exporter in code
* Have the Zipkin endpoint available to receive traces

{{<highlight python>}}
#!/usr/bin/env python

from opencensus.trace.exporters.zipkin_exporter import ZipkinExporter
from opencensus.trace.tracer import Tracer

def main():
    ze = ZipkinExporter(service_name="service-a",
                        host_name='localhost',
                        port=9411,
                        endpoint='/api/v2/spans')

    tracer = Tracer(exporter=ze)
    with tracer.span(name='doingWork') as span:
        for i in range(10):
            continue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

#### Viewing your traces
