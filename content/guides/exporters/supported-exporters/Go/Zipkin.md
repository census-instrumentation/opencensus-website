This guide makes use of Zipkin for visualizing your data. For assistance setting up Zipkin, [Click here](/codelabs/zipkin) for a guided codelab.

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.

It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the Google Dapper paper.

OpenCensus Go has support for this exporter available through package [go.opencensus.io/exporter/zipkin](https://godoc.org/go.opencensus.io/exporter/zipkin)

##### Creating the exporter
To create the exporter, we'll need to:

* Create an exporter in code
* Have the Zipkin endpoint available to receive traces

{{<highlight go>}}
package main

import (
	"log"

	"go.opencensus.io/exporter/zipkin"
	"go.opencensus.io/trace"

	openzipkin "github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-go"
	zipkinHTTP "github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-go/reporter/http"
)

func main() {
	localEndpointURI := "192.168.1.5:5454"
	reporterURI := "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans"
	serviceName := "server"

	localEndpoint, err := openzipkin.NewEndpoint(serviceName, localEndpointURI)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create Zipkin localEndpoint with URI %q error: %v", localEndpointURI, err)
	}

	reporter := zipkinHTTP.NewReporter(reporterURI)
	ze := zipkin.NewExporter(reporter, localEndpoint)

	// And now finally register it as a Trace Exporter
	trace.RegisterExporter(ze)
}
