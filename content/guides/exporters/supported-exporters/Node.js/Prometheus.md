## Introduction
Prometheus is a monitoring system that collects metrics, by scraping
exposed endpoints at regular intervals, evaluating rule expressions.
It can also trigger alerts if certain conditions are met.

OpenCensus Node.js has support for this exporter available, distributed through NPM package [@opencensus/exporter-prometheus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opencensus/exporter-prometheus)

## Installing the exporter
You can install OpenCensus Prometheus Exporter by running these steps:

```bash
npm install @opencensus/core
npm install @opencensus/exporter-prometheus
```

## Creating the exporter
Now let's use the Prometheus exporter:

```js
var {AggregationType, Measure, MeasureUnit, Stats} = require('@opencensus/core');
var prometheus = require('@opencensus/exporter-prometheus');

var stats = new Stats();

var exporter = new prometheus.PrometheusTraceExporter({
  port: 9464,
  startServer: false
});
stats.registerExporter(exporter);

exporter.startServer(function callback() {
  // Callback
});
```
