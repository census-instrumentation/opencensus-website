## Introduction
Jaeger, inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies.
It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, including:

* Distributed context propagation
* Distributed transaction monitoring
* Root cause analysis
* Service dependency analysis
* Performance / latency optimization

OpenCensus Node.js has support for this exporter available, distributed through NPM package [@opencensus/exporter-jaeger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opencensus/exporter-jaeger)

## Installing the exporter
You can install OpenCensus Jaeger Exporter by running these steps:

```bash
npm install @opencensus/core
npm install @opencensus/nodejs
npm install @opencensus/exporter-jaeger
```

## Creating the exporter
Now let's use the Jaeger exporter:

```js
var core = require('@opencensus/core');
var tracing = require('@opencensus/nodejs');
var jaeger = require('@opencensus/exporter-jaeger');

var jaegerOptions = {
  serviceName: 'opencensus-exporter-jaeger',
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 6832,
  tags: [{key: 'opencensus-exporter-jeager', value: '0.0.1'}],
  bufferTimeout: 10, // time in milliseconds
  logger: core.logger('debug'),
  maxPacketSize: 1000
};

var exporter = new jaeger.JaegerTraceExporter();

tracing.registerExporter(exporter).start();
```
