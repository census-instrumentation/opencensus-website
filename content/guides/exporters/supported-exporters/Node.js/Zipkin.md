## Introduction
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.

It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the Google Dapper paper.

OpenCensus Node.js has support for this exporter available, distributed through NPM package [@opencensus/exporter-zipkin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opencensus/exporter-zipkin)

## Installing the exporter
You can install OpenCensus Zipkin Exporter by running these steps:

```bash
npm install @opencensus/nodejs
npm install @opencensus/exporter-zipkin
```

## Creating the exporter
Now let's use the Zipkin exporter:

```js
var tracing = require('@opencensus/nodejs');
var zipkin = require('@opencensus/exporter-zipkin');

// Add your zipkin url (ex http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans)
// and application name to the Zipkin options
var options = {
  url: 'your-zipkin-url',
  serviceName: 'your-application-name'
};

var exporter = new zipkin.ZipkinTraceExporter(options);
tracing.registerExporter(exporter).start();
```
