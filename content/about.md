OpenCensus is being developed by a group of cloud providers,
Application Performance Management vendors, and open source contributors.
This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/census-instrumentation) and all work occurs there.

OpenCensus was initiated by Google, and is based on instrumentation systems
used inside of Google. OpenCensus is a complete rewrite of the Google system
and has no Google intellectual property.
