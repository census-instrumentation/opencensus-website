#### Measure

A measure represents a metric type to be recorded. For example, request latency
in Âµs and request size in KBs are examples of measures to collect from a server.

### Definition
All measures are identified by a name and also have a description and a unit.
Libraries and frameworks can define and export measures for their end users to
collect data on the provided measures.  

Constituent|Description|Example|Restrictions
---|---|---|---
Name|a string by which the measure will be referred to by|"rpc_server_latency", "vm_cpu_cycles"|MUST be unique within the library. It is recommended to use names compatible with the intended end usage e.g. use host/path pattern
Description|a string detailing the purpose of the measure|"RPC latency in milliseconds", "Virtual cycles executed on a VM|
Unit|a string descriptive of the unit of the Measure|"By", "1", "ms"|MUST follow [Unified code for units of </br> measure](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html)

### Types
OpenCensus currently supports two types of measures

Type|Description
---|---
Int64|Records int-like values
Float64|Records float-like values

### Recording measurements
[Measurements](/stats/measurement) are produced by recording a numeric value with a [Measure](#measure) usually in a [tagContext](/tag)

### Source code example

{{<highlight go>}}
package main

import (
	"go.opencensus.io/stats"
)

func main() {
	mLatencyMs = stats.Float64("latency", "The latency in milliseconds", "ms")
	mLines = stats.Int64("lines_in", "The number of lines processed", "1")
	mBytesIn = stats.Int64("bytes_in", "The number of bytes received", "By")

	// Invoking .M produces measurements that we then record against
	// a context "ctx" with tags.
	stats.Record(ctx,
		mLatencyMs.M(17),
		mLines.M(238),

### Relation to Measurements
When a Measure records a value, it produces a [Measurement](/stats/measurement).

### Relation to Views
A [View](/stats/view) couples the Measurement produced by a Measure, with an [Aggregation](/stats/view#aggregation) and optionally [Tags](/tag) to produce metrics.
