OpenCensus provides observability for your microservices and monoliths alike.

It gives you the tools to track a request as it travels through each of your services, and it helps you gather any metrics of interest.

The core functionality of OpenCensus is to collect traces and metrics from your app, display them locally, and send them to any analysis tool. However, OpenCensus provides a lot more than just data insight. This page describes some of that functionality and points you to resources for building it into your app.

After [instrumenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(computer_programming)#Output) your code with OpenCensus, you will equip yourself with the ability to optimize the speed of your services, understand exactly how a request travels between your services, gather any useful metrics about your entire architecture, and more.

## Why OpenCensus?

##### Visualize Request Lifecycle
You can track a request as it propagates throughout all of your services. Additionally, you can visualize your data in any [backend](/core-concepts/exporters/#supported-backends) with a one-step solution.

##### Perform Root-Cause Analysis
Gain total situation-clarity in your distributed services architecture. When your service runs in to a problem, use OpenCensus to identify the point of failure.

##### Optimize Service Latency
Become empowered to optimize every component in your distributed services by gaining key insights in to the latency and performance of every microservice and data storage you manage.
