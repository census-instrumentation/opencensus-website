{{<title>}} is a vendor-agnostic single distribution of libraries to provide observability for your microservices and monoliths alike. OpenCensus is an open source community developed project. Its origins stem from the rewrite of what has been Google's observability systems for the past 10 years.

OpenCensus is implemented in a plethora of languages and it allows you to singly collect metrics and traces
and then export them to a variety of backends.

In this section we will walk through what OpenCensus is, what problems it solves, and how it can help your project.
