Tags are key-value pairs of data that are associated with collected metrics, to
provide contextual information, distinguish and group metrics during analysis and inspection.

Some examples of tags are:

* `frontend=ofe`
* `user_agent="ios-10.2.12"`
* `method="push"`
* `value=12`
* `customer_id=44ca62e0-44a3-4c67-9955-33805d551d01`

#### Propagation

Tags can be defined in one service's requests and then serialized on the wire to downstream services
that the request progresses through.

In distributed systems, a single request could touch a wide range of isolated services.
For example a file upload request can invoke the authentication and billing service, the data storage
service, the caching service etc. which might all be isolated and invokable by [Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)

To maintain contextual information of the specific request, tag propagation through
your distributed system is necessary; the higher levels generate tags that are then
passed down to the invoked lower level services and eventually those are sent to your observability systems.

From the above drawing, a request comes in through the frontend server/service,
the tags:

* `customer_id=foo_bar`
* `originator=photoop_svc`

are assigned to that request and propagated as it goes through layers:

* Authentication
* Database
* Cloud storage
* Content Delivery Network(CDN)
etc.

and with those tags, you can uniquely identify and break down which service called
the downstream services, how much quota they've used, what calls are failing etc.
