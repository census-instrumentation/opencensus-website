#### [Easier and More Powerful Observability with the OpenCensus Agent and Collector](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/06/easier-and-more-powerful-observability.html)

We’ve recently enhanced OpenCensus with two new components: an optional agent that can manage exporters and collect system telemetry
from VMs and containers, and an optional collector service that offers improved trace sampling and metrics aggregation.
While we’ve already demonstrated these components on stage at Kubecon and Next, we’re now ready to show them more broadly
and encourage their use ...

#### [OpenTelemetry: The Merger of OpenCensus and OpenTracing](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/05/21/a-brief-history-of-opentelemetry-so-far/)

After many months of planning, discussion, prototyping, more discussion, and more planning,
OpenTracing and OpenCensus are merging to form [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io), which is now a CNCF sandbox project.
The seed governance committee is composed of representatives from Google, Lightstep, Microsoft,
and Uber, and more organizations are getting involved every day ...

#### [Merging OpenTracing and OpenCensus: A Roadmap to Convergence](https://medium.com/opentracing/a-roadmap-to-convergence-b074e5815289)

We are creating a new, unified set of libraries and specifications for
observability telemetry. It will [merge the OpenTracing and
OpenCensus](https://medium.com/opentracing/merging-opentracing-and-opencensus-f0fe9c7ca6f0)
projects. Learn about [roadmap to
convergence](https://medium.com/opentracing/a-roadmap-to-convergence-b074e5815289)

#### [Google NEXT 2019: Complete Production Observability With OpenCensus](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=268946-130602)

At Google NEXT 2019 we presented OpenCensus in one of breakout sessions. There
were three presenters. [Morgan McLean](https://github.com/mtwo) gave an overview
of the OpenCensus and demonstrated new Agent system counters collection
capabilities, [Sergey Kanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev) talked
about developments over the last year and talked about plans on logging API and
OpenTracing merger, [Steve Flanders](https://github.com/flands) made a demo of
OpenCensus and latest development in Agent and Collector. Thank you for
everybody attended. You can view [session
recording](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=268946-130602)
on demand. Slides of this session can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yFPTjNwu75VBoHmqvXTLi_5j-6UW1lADYuQeHQ4H3Zc).

#### [Merging OpenTracing and OpenCensus: Goals and Non-Goals](https://medium.com/opentracing/merging-opentracing-and-opencensus-f0fe9c7ca6f0)

Two projects — OpenTracing and OpenCensus — are very similar in that they aim to
unify app instrumentation and make observability a built-in feature in every
modern application. Over the past few months, leaders from both communities have
formed a technical committee to help facilitate project convergence. Read about
overarching [goals (and non-goals) regarding this project
